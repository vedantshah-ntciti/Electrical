# Electrical Engineering Solver ⚡

A streamlined Python environment for solving complex electrical engineering formulas using NumPy and custom calculation modules.

## ⚙️ Requirements
To ensure compatibility with the mathematical models, the following version is required:
* **NumPy**: `2.3.4`

```bash
pip install numpy==2.3.4
```

**How to use:**

Just Write your requirement in solve.py in the function solve()

**Code in solve.py:**
```python
from ElectricalCalculation import ElectricalFormulae as ef
import math, cmath
import numpy as np

def solve():
    #write the code here
    pass

print(solve())
```
