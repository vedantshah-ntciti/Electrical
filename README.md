Electrical Formula useful to me in basic electical engineering.

**Requirements to Use:**

Numpy : Version 2.3.4

**How to use:**

Just Write your requirement in solve.py in the function solve()

**Code in solve.py:**
from ElectricalCalculation import ElectricalFormulae as ef
import math, cmath
import numpy as np

def solve():
    #write the code here
    pass

print(solve())
